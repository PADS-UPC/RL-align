# RL-align

RL-align performs conformance checking aligning log traces with a PM Petri net.
It uses relaxation labeling (RL) constraint satisfaction algorithm to perform the alignment. 

Obtained alignments may be suboptimal or unfitting. However, the computation time is linear with the traec length, offering computation times about two orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art methods.
